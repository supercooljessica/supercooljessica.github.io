            Inspired by the intercalary chapters in Steinbeck's <em>The Grapes of Wrath</em>, this short story describes human experiences on a larger-than-individual level.

    <p>They had all arrived on the verge of thirty, on the verge of starting families. They were wide-eyed and idealistic parents, and their kids grew up together. They went to PTA meetings, recreational soccer games, and school plays. At a certain point, the lines that bound them as separate families vanished and they became one. Sleepovers, pool parties, and the occasional minor dispute. They watched as their children moved from preschool to third grade, then on to middle school, where they grew into angst-filled teenagers, and it only brought the parents closer. Through high school, they watched their kids date one another, chuckling to themselves and remembering how foolish they too once were. College acceptances came and went, and now it was May. As if a tsunami had swept through the entire town, all the houses went on the market, and all the familiar chatter died down. Alas, it was time to leave.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Some were off to New York City to try and replace the chaos that their children once provided. The radical ones bought property in the middle of the country. The rest were searching for a larger town where they could buy a small home and hide. Yes, they would hide. Because now they knew if they let themselves grow close to their neighbors once again, it would hurt far too much to leave. It already hurt too much.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>There they sat quietly at graduation, unsuccessfully holding back tears, for their children had walked onto that stage for the final time. Diplomas were handed out, but a piece of paper could never begin to describe the last eighteen years of their lives. While their children launched their caps into the air with anticipation for the future, the parents looked at one another with sadness, a mutual understanding that this was goodbye.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>They broke the news to their kids a few days later. After all, the moving truck would be arriving soon. Their kids had already known, but it did not stop them from arguing. They would not give up their childhood so easily.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p><em>But this is the park where I learned to ride my bike.</em></p>
    <p>And now you know how to ride it.</p>
    <p><em>But this is the violin shop where I took lessons for ten years.</em></p>
    <p>And now it&rsquo;s closing.</p>
    <p><em>But this is the store where we get groceries every Sunday after church.</em></p>
    <p>You never liked their vanilla ice cream anyway.</p>
    <p><em>But this is the soccer field where I scored my first goal. And this is the building where I took karate lessons every Monday and Wednesday night. And this is the fireplace next to which I fell asleep every Christmas Eve waiting for Santa. And this school&hellip; this school is where I became myself.</em></p>
    <p>Honey, I know you don&rsquo;t want to leave, but we must put sentimentality aside. The taxes are high in this town and your college tuition is expensive. Downsizing is our only option.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>There were a thousand more buts, a thousand more reasons not to leave. But what Mother had said was irrefutable. So the soon-to-be college students packed their things. They packed away their childhoods, photographs from particularly awful picture days. Halloween costumes they wore several years in a row to save money. Ticket stubs from their first high school dance. All stuffed into boxes that Mother promised would be moved into the new house. But they knew that once an item was sealed into the large cardboard box, a part of it would never come back out.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>They sold their houses to young couples on the verge of thirty.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Are you planning on having kids?</p>
    <p><em>Oh yes, this seems like a wonderful place to raise a family.</em></p>
    <p>It is.</p>

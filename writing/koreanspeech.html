    </h3>

    <p>Hello. Today, I’d like to talk about my favorite bread.</p>

    <p>
      In my hometown, there’s a bakery I used to visit often with my grandmother.
      They had a big bread called <em>gonggal-bbang</em> (a large, hollow bread).
      I remember thinking, <q>It’s bigger than the other breads—why is it only two dollars?</q>
      My grandmother bought me one, and I took an excited first bite:
      <q>Huh? What is this bread?</q> There was nothing inside.
      I thought it would be hard and tasteless, but the more I ate, the softer and tastier it was.
      It wasn’t what I first imagined.
    </p>

    <p>
      I wrestled in middle school and was the smallest on the team.
      Whenever I competed, everyone watching assumed I would lose, and my opponents kept flipping me over.
      But I practiced hard every day and finally won.
      From then on, big opponents didn’t scare me, and during every match I thought of
      <em>gonggal-bbang</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      In college I majored in mathematics, and the problems became very difficult.
      Math is my favorite subject, but sometimes I think about a single problem for hours and still can’t solve it.
      At times like that, I think of <em>gonggal-bbang</em>:
      it looks complicated and difficult, but if I face it with confidence,
      I can find the answer more simply than I expected.
    </p>

    <p>
      These days there are more tough things like exams and interviews.
      Sometimes I worry before I even begin and feel like giving up.
      But if we prepare well and don’t give up, success will surely come.
      When you run into something hard, think of <em>gonggal-bbang</em> too!
    </p>

    <p>Thank you for listening to my story.</p>

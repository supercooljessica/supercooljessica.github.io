        Description:
    </h3>
    <p>
        Wooden pillows (목침) are common in Korean saunas for sleeping on the heated floor.
        Despite looking uncomfortable, they are perfect for a short nap and are easy to clean.
        I used a CNC mill to cut out beveled pieces to my exact specifications and glued them together to create this fun item!
        Everyone I've shown it to has been extremely skeptical at first, but after lying on it, they all say it is way more comfortable than they would have expected!

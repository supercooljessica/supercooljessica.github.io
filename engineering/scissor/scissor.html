        Description:
    </h3>
    <p>
        Inspired by Chuck Hoberman's famous expanding sphere, this mechanism reimagines the scissor linkage, but with an additional degree of freedom.
        Rotating hinges allow the links to collapse as they normally would, as well as bend on an additional orthogonal axis.
        Two sets are attached to each other to constrain the bend, and the curvature is uniquely defined by the ratio of these two lengths.
    </p>
    <p>
        This mechanism has potential use for robot arms or joints which need an additional degree of freedom.
        I am still actively working on building a powered actuator for this mechanism.
    </p>

        Additionally, see the below video for another version of a 2DOF scissor linkage which utilizes a linear shear.

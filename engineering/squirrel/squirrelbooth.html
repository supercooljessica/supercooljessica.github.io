        Description:
    </h3>
    <p>
        Squirrels are fascinating creatures!  Inspired by Mark Rober's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFZFjoX2cGg" target="_blank">squirrel obstacle courses</a>, I wanted to make a similar device to interact with my cute, furry neighbors.
        This device is a pressure-activated camera system which snaps a photo when a weight is detected on the base.
        The cardboard base lies on top of a limit switch, so a small weight closes the circuit and is read by the microcontroller.
        An old iPhone is hooked up via the audio jack to take a photo when the sensor is activated.
        This project was completed during COVID, so there were lots of squirrels out and about, and I ended up getting some great shots!

        Description:
    </h3>
    <p>
        The game of Egyptian Rat Screw is a speed-based card game which involves dealing and slapping cards.
        I loved this game growing up and fondly recall playing with my friends on the bus ride to math tournaments.
        My goal is to build a robot to play against.

        The slapping mechanism is controlled by a stepper motor with a half-gear which slips and allows the spring to quickly pull down the arm.
        An ESP32-CAM is mounted separately and scans for QR codes on the cards.
        In the future, this may be changed to full image recognition.
        The video above shows the slapping mechanism.
        A flexible hand will be mounted at the end of the rod (see below).

        Description:
    </h3>
    <p>
        When I moved into my first apartment, they gave me four different keys to unlock various doors just to enter my unit.
        As it grew colder in Boston, I found it extremely inconvenient to come home after a long day of work and stand outside the apartment building fumbling for my keys just to enter the building and get warm.
        So instead, I built a robot arm which detects when I buzz my own unit and automatically lets me in.

    <p>
        You're probably wondering, doesn't that mean anyone can buzz my apartment and be let in?
        Technically... yes.  But it only opens the front door (not my unit), and random people can always pretty easily get in at any time.
        So far, this has been an absolute game changer, especially when I'm carrying groceries, and has been a great conversation starter when people come visit!

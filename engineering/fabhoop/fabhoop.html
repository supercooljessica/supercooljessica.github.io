        Description:
    </h3>
    <p>
        Quidditch (now referred to as "quadball") is a sport from the world of Harry Potter.
        In the real-life adaptation, players compete to score a volleyball through a set of hula hoops.
        When a player attempts to shoot or dunk the ball, it is quite difficult to see if it actually traveled through the hoop because the view can often be obstructed.
    </p>
    <p>
        This device automatically detects if the ball has passed through the plane of the hoop.
        It relies on Faraday's Law of Magnetic Induction which states that a changing magnetic field through a loop of wire produces a current.
        The ball is embedded with a magnet and the hoop contains a coil of wire so that when the ball travels through, a small current is picked up and signals the LEDs to light up.
        This design allows for other objects to pass through the hoop without being picked up by the sensor.
